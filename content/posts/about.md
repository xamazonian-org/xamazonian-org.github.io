The xamazonian.org community was formed to bring together Amazon alumni and current Amazonians interested in helping ex-Amazon entrepreneurs.

Please join us to access our global community of members and events to help your startup succeed.

Some of our events include regular meetups about startup growth tactics and brainstorming sessions with founders to address their specific challenges. We also have an active slack group where ex-Amazonians can help each other.
