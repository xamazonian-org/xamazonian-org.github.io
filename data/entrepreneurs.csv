He then moved to consulting in London for firms including Goldman Sachs, Thomson Reuters and CMC Markets. After spending almost eight years in London, Bhaskar relocated to Singapore in 2012, where he continued leading the Asian business of Armstrong as the Business Head for APAC. In his various capacity, he helped many businesses digitise their business models. Despite having a background in finance, Bhaskar still found investing to be a painful process – due to its complexity and the lack of digital tools available. Throughout his two decades of experience working with top financial institutions, he also felt that there were few financial institutions that catered to the emerging middle class.  With a vision to reduce complexities and improve the advisory experience in the traditional wealth management sector, Bhaskar founded WeInvest in 2015, a digital wealth solutions provider that enables financial institutions to service their clients better with their innovative digital offerings.  While in the US, he had business exchanges with Rajesh Arjunlal Jaisingh, who had set up business operations for HSBC and Lehman Brothers in India. Rajesh, who strongly resonated with Bhaskar’s vision for WeInvest, later became the COO of WeInvest. WeInvest has since partnered with financial institutions to develop digital wealth platforms including OCBC’s RoboInvest, CGS-CIMB’s e-Wealth and Siam Commercial Bank’ wPlan.

As the Co-Founder and CEO of Plunk, Lent is embarking on a mission to build “the Bloomberg of residential real estate”—starting with the launch of Plunk as the first real-time home analytics platform. With a world-class team of data scientists and engineers, Lent is bringing advanced computer vision, AI, and ML algorithms to the world’s largest asset class—residential real estate.  Prior to Plunk, Lent founded the mobile cloud analytics company Medio Systems, supporting 440+ million consumers in over 100+ countries. In 2014, Medio Systems was acquired by Nokia (HERE Technologies), after which Lent was promoted to Chief Technology Officer. For the next four years, Lent lead a worldwide technology and R&D organization, and spearheaded the company’s primary technology roadmap and strategic direction, including product innovation, research, and multi-tiered mixed public cloud analytics technology.   Previous to HERE, Lent spent most of his career leading groundbreaking technology work for companies including IBM and Junglee, which was acquired by Amazon. At Amazon, Lent created the company’s first data mining group, formed its analytic infrastructure, and integrated Junglee’s recommendation engine into Amazon’s data-driven consumer experiences and predictive analytics system—which ultimately drives more than 30% of Amazon’s online sales.   Through an Amazon spin-off, Lent founded Intelligent Results, and applied similar real-time predictive analytics and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to the financial services industry—innovating an improved FICO score that raised predictive accuracy by 30% to 60% and becoming the new bar in evaluating consumer credit worthiness. Intelligent Results was acquired by First Data Corporation.  While earning his Masters and Ph.D. candidacy at Stanford University in Computer Science, in 1995, he co-founded ‘Mining Data at Stanford’ (MiDAS)—the research lab which incubated the Google crawler and search engine—with fellow student Sergey Brin. Prior to Stanford, he founded his first company Micro Revelations, an early pioneer of machine-learning based PC computer games, acquired by Electronic Arts.   A recipient of both the prestigious National Science Foundation and Department of Defense Office of Naval Research Graduate Fellowships, Lent is a key industry thought leader and author of numerous professional publications and patents.
